# Why I built this

I teach groups of students, and they sometimes share the Wi-Fi password with friends from other groups. That’s understandable, but during lessons the connection gets sluggish when too many extra devices join. The router’s default admin page only shows cryptic hostnames and MAC addresses and that's fine for machines, but humans can’t really keep that many random numbers in their heads, so I can’t really tell who’s who. That’s why I built this extension.
