#Why I built this
I teach groups of students, and students sometimes share password with friends from other groups. Thats understandable, but during lessons the connection gets sluggish when lots of extra devices join. The routers default admin page only shows cryptic hostnames and MACs, which is of course fine but human cant realy handle to much random numbers in ther mind so I cant realy tell who is who. So thats why I built this extension.
